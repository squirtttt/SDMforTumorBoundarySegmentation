# Self-Training with Signed Distance Maps for Enhanced Tumor Boundary Segmentation in Histopathology

## Description
We propose a self-training-based pseudo labeling to address the scarcity of annotated histopathology data. Further, the proposed architecture incorporates the concept of the Signed Distance Map (SDM) to facilitate robust boundary learning in complex pathological structures. 
## Environment Setup

    conda env create -f pseudo-u.yaml
    conda activate pseudo-u


## Data setup
This paper conducts experiments on customized breast cancer dataset.
