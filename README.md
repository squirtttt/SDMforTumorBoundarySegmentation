# Self-Training with Signed Distance Maps for Enhanced Tumor Boundary Segmentation in Histopathology


We propose a self-training-based pseudo labeling to address the scarcity of annotated histopathology data. Further, the proposed architecture incorporates the concept of the Signed Distance Map (SDM) to facilitate robust boundary learning in complex pathological structures.
